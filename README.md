# Next.js with Tailwind CSS Template

This is a starter template for a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS. It's set up with some of the most common tools and configurations that you might need.

## Features

- Next.js: A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.
- ESLint: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `pnpm dev` - Runs the app in the development mode.
- `pnpm build` - Builds the app for production.
- `pnpm start` - Runs the built app in production mode.
- `pnpm lint` - Runs the linter (ESLint).
